Java

You are given an array consisting of n integers which denote the position of a stall. You are also given an integer k which denotes the number of aggressive cows. You are given the task of assigning stalls to k cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.
The first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and k.
The second line contains n space-separated integers denoting the position of the stalls.
