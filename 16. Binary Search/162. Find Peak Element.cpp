A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.


class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.size()-1;
        while(low < high){
            int mid1 = (low+high)/2;
            int mid2 = mid1+1;
            if(nums[mid1] < nums[mid2]) low = mid2;
            else high = mid1;
        }
        return low;
        // can return anything low or high
    }
};
